# LOGO_Python
LOGO was an old programming language used to teach kids programming. It comprised of a turtle that moved on the screen based on the commands given to it.
IT could also plot the trajectory of its movement so that you can visualise the series of commands it was given.
However, this was discontinued! the file here recreates this simulation in python using basic Object Oriented Programming (OOP) techniques

This file is used to teach not only OOP but also to have fun
